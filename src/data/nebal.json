    "text": "If you had your way, you’d lead an idyllic life staying at home and tending your garden, perfectly boring and peaceful. You don’t know why you keep leaving home and walking the roads and trails of the land. It is never your choice, at least never your direct choice, but circumstances conspire and there you are, a hundred miles from home, cold, wet and without your handkerchiefs. You never actually enjoy your adventures… do you?(Skill Proficiencies: Medicine, Nature)(Feature: Pathetic and Bedraggled)You can take on the mien of a sad, desperate and despondent figure. As long as you are not threatening, strangers will take pity on you and give you a warm place to sleep for the night, hot food and a bit of comfort. Every time this happens you promise yourself that you will just stay home, yet you always soon find yourself back out in the Wild, living off of roots and berries, without any handkerchiefs.(Suggested Characteristics)Reluctant Adventurers are always easy to spot; they are cold and miserable and they tend to let everyone around them know about it. They are only on this adventure because of some skill or talent that the rest of the company lacks. Deep down inside, however, some Reluctant Adventurers really enjoy the thrill of exploring new places and having grand adventures. Such individuals don’t mind sharing one or two moments of merriment at their circumstances but they are careful to let those around them know that such moments are fleeting.(Distinctive Quality)
    Cautious. You prefer a careful – you would say sensible – approach to all your adventures, as you know things can always go wrong.
    Clever. Perhaps it’s because you don’t think like an adventurer but you often think of ingenious solutions to company problems.
    Cunning. Your words are dripping with sarcasm and you have a way of cutting people where it hurts the most.
    Grim. You can’t conceal your misery and it makes others uneasy around you.
    Gruff. You’re here because the company needs your skills; no more, no less.
    Merciful. Your own failings on the road give you sympathy for the failings of others.
    Suspicious. Your naivety got you into this mess; you won’t be caught off-guard again.
    Wary. You don’t trust anyone out here in the strange wilderness; everyone is out to get you.
    (Speciality)
    Burglary. Your company values your skills at finding a way into places unnoticed.
    Cooking. You keep your company well-fed and you’re always on the look-out for new recipes and ingredients; you may as well make something out of this miserable travelling!
    Elven-lore. Unfortunately for you, there aren’t many who are well-versed in the ways of the Elves.
    Leechcraft. The company brought you along because you are the only one who can patch them up when they invariably run into trouble.
    Old Lore. Rather than take a library of books with them to an ancient ruin, your company chose to take you and your vast knowledge of the past.
    Tunnelling. Few know the caves and tunnels – and the dangers contained therein – as well as you do.
    (Hope)
    My fond memories of home can get me through any difficulties.
    I know that one day I shall rest by my fire again.
    I am only out in this miserable world because I am needed. It feels good to be needed!
    I keep my friends grounded and remind them of what they can look forward to when they return to their homes.
    I shall have such stories to tell when I return home!
    I revel in the camaraderie that I’ve never had at home, even when it’s under such miserable conditions.
    (Despair)
    I shall never see my home again.
    I am not the expert my company thought I was.
    Fate hates me; I am constantly tossed into these dangerous situations in the hopes that the world will finally be rid of me!
    I am ill-suited for adventure. One day my friends will let their guard down and I won’t be able to defend myself.
    Terrible things will happen if I don’t go home soon!
    Even if I get home, I am sure that something horrible will follow me back."
